If there's a significant number of attendees, I'll work on securing our own dedicated space for next time.  A presentation night is also in the works, probably end of July-early August, details might be solidified by time of the hack night.",
            
            "For logistics, generally from observations at previous Python Hack nights, people congregate around the central table and slowly extend as seats fill, but generally there's plenty of extra space. I'd like to propose Go people to sit in the couch circles towards the end of the room.  I a Gopher plushie and some signage to home in peopel.",
            
            "Having event numbers ahead of time helps out with organizing(chairs, power strips, etc) so I'd like to ask people to RSVP in some manner; preferably through their Meetup Event. I'll signal the PDXPython group of our numbers prior the event. As for etiquette, it's necessary to note that this is PDXPython's hack night, so please respect their Code of Conduct(Be nice, don't be a jerk) and everything will be great. :)",
